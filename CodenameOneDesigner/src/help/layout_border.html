    <h1>Border Layout</h1>
    <p>
        <img src="layout_border.png"><br>Border layout places components
        in positions based on a constrain defined in the component. The component
        may have one of 5 positions: north, south, east, west or center.
    </p>
    <p>
        North/south components are sized based on the component's preferred height
        and their width grabs the available space. East and west components do the
        exact oposite of that.<br>
        The center component grabs up all remaining space to capture the rest of
        the screen by default unless absolute center is checked in which case it
        will be placed in its preferred size in the center (assuming there is
        enough space, it will not disturb the other components). Notice that
        if there is not enough room for components in north/south/east/west they
        might overlap each other producing an underiable effect.
    </p>
    <p>
        Border layout allows swapping component position on orientation change
        by selecting an alternative position for a component in landscape.
        When this feature is used the position constraint within the layout is
        assumed to mean portrait mode (phone standing up) and the user can define
        how landscape mode changes that behavior.
