      <h1>Running A UI/Theme on a RIM Blackberry Device</h1>
    <p>
        Codename One supports generating a "preview application" on the fly to allow designers
        to preview their UI on an actual device. This requires some work to configure
        for the first time and isn't intended as a "production" tool, however once
        configured this is an immensly powerful tool for a designer providing the
        designer with the "feel" of the theme on a specific device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Running on RIM devices requires a device with OS 4.7 or newer and requires
        a RIM JDE installation (it is assumed the Java JDK required by RIM is
        already installed, although the Codename One Designer can be run with the JRE alone).
        RIM's JRE can be downloaded from their website at
        <a href="http://us.blackberry.com/developers/javaappdev/javadevenv.jsp">http://us.blackberry.com/developers/javaappdev/javadevenv.jsp</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        When running the wizard for the first time one has to point at the directory
        where the JRE is installed if it was not installed at the default location.
        A RIM device needs to be connected to the machine with a USB cable for the
        wizard to work as expected.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the wizard fails in uploading to the device or building you can look
        within the details tab for the reason for the failure. While the details
        tab is quite technical once this actually works on a machine it can be
        ignored. Notice that unless you exited the application (the red button
        minimizes and doesn't exit on RIM!) the device will reboot and an upload
        to the device will take allot of time!
    </p>
    <p>
        When a UI is executed on the device a combo box is presented allowing you
        to pick the UI form to start with. This is useful for a designer to preview
        starting from an arbitrary form in the middle of the application and not
        necessarily going through the full application flow which might not be
        applicable without application code.
