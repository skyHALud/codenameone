      <h1>Running A UI/Theme on a Generic MIDP Device</h1>
    <p>
        LWUIT supports generating a "preview MIDlet" on the fly to allow designers
        to preview their UI on an actual device.  This is an immensly powerful tool for a designer providing the
        designer with the "feel" of the theme on a specific device.
    </p>
    <p>
        While LWUIT has support for running directly on a device for some specific devices (Nokia, RIM),
        there is still no standard for installing MIDP applications directly from the PC. This operation
        allows you to generate a jad/jar pair which can be installed manually on most common devices
        in the market by saving them to the SDCARD and clicking the jad or jar to install/run.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few devices will only work when running in OTA (Over The Air) mode, which effectively means
        you would need to host the jad/jar on an appropriate server and install them via a device
        browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a UI is executed on the device a combo box is presented allowing you
        to pick the UI form to start with. This is useful for a designer to preview
        starting from an arbitrary form in the middle of the application and not
        necessarily going through the full application flow which might not be
        applicable without application code.
