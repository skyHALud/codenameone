    <title>List Cell Renderer</title>

    <p>
        To create a list renderer you must first create a Container entry in
        the GUI builder and populate it with components.
    </p>
    <p>
        A renderer is used to define how the information within the model (the data
        of the list) is displayed to the user. A render in the GUI builder is a
        Container that can have any set of components. Components that can contain
        text and icons should normally have names matching entries within
        the model (e.g. if the model has a key with a given name the renderer
        component with the same name will display it). This diagram tries to
        explain the relationship between the model, List and renderer:

        <img src="renderer_diagram.png" /><br>
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a renderer value that doesn't change based on a key (e.g. a
        hardcoded application value) just append the word Fixed to the end of
        the component name when creating it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UIID (component style) of the renderer will match the UIID of the
        container given here, notice that a focus style is also relevant to
        a list (its the element appearing behind the selected entry) and that
        element UIID bares the same name as the Container style with the word
        Focus appended.<br>
        The renderer supports two major special cases: Fisheye and pinstipe.
        The fisheye renderer allows using a separate container type to represent
        the selected entry which can result in pretty unique UI's. The pinstripe
        mode allows defining a separate look for odd/even rows in the list to
        create an effect of pinstriping.
