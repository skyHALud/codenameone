      <h1>Running A UI/Theme on a Nokia Device</h1>
    <p>
        LWUIT supports generating a "preview MIDlet" on the fly to allow designers
        to preview their UI on an actual device. This requires some work to configure
        for the first time and isn't intended as a "production" tool, however once
        configured this is an immensly powerful tool for a designer providing the
        designer with the "feel" of the theme on a specific device.
    </p>
    <p>
        Running on Nokia devices requires the Nokia PC suite which is used to upload
        the resulting application directly to the device.
    </p>
    <p>
        When running the wizard for the first time one has to point to the directory
        where the PC suite is installed if it was not installed at the default location.
        A Nokia device needs to be connected to the machine with a USB cable or
        bluetooth to get this to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a UI is executed on the device a combo box is presented allowing you
        to pick the UI form to start with. This is useful for a designer to preview
        starting from an arbitrary form in the middle of the application and not
        necessarily going through the full application flow which might not be
        applicable without application code.
