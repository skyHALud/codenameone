      <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        The theme editor allows designers to customize the appearance of a LWUIT
        application or GUI builder UI and see a live preview of said changes
        in the preview pane on the right side. The preview pane is "live" and
        supports keyboard/mouse interaction, it can also be customized extensively
        by clicking its options button.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default the LWUIT Demo application is presented in the preview pane
        however you can pick a custom LWUIT MIDlet or use any form from the GUI
        builder builtin to this tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        To gain a deep understanding of the tool and its full potential we suggest
        you check out the tutorials in the help menu that are based on video
        screen casts.
    </p>
      <h1>Basics</h1>
    <p>
        If you are familiar with CSS then the theme editor is a much simplified
        version of that with simpler selectors and more refined attributes.
        LWUIT applications are comprised of components each of which has a UIID
        (User Interface ID), the UIID defaults to the component type (e.g. a
        button has the "Button" UIID) however a developer/designer may change
        the UIID to provide greater range (more on that later).<br>
        A UIID is the main part of the "selector" it allows a theme to
        define the element to customize, a selector is matched by a set
        of values indicating what is being customized.
    </p>
    <p>
        E.g. If you would like all the buttons to be drawn in blue you
        can add a Button entry and set its foreground color to Blue.<br>
        However, this will only work for some of the buttons since a selector
        has another important part based on the state of the component.
        LWUIT components can be unselected (unfocused), selected (focused),
        pressed (only buttons support this) or disabled. To make the button
        blue for all cases we will need to define the button as blue in all
        4 tabs (we can ease this using inheritance).
    </p>
    <p>
        Each selector (UIID + state) can have a style associated with it, a style
        contains multiple attribute values that can either be inherited or
        replaced with your custom settings (e.g. foreground color). For more
        information click the "Add" button bellow and select the help tab.
    </p>
      <h1>Inheritance</h1>
    <p>
        LWUIT has a base style for every component state, this base style determines
        the "starting point" for a component specific style. E.g. if I want all
        components to be blue I can change the default style to blue, I will need
        to do this for disabled, pressed and selected tabs as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than that LWUIT has no implicit inheritance (although it has some
        elaborate default settings for components), it does have explicit inheritance
        where its possible to define a UIID from which to derive the attribute
        values.
