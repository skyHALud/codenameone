    <p>
        The virtual keyboard/text field input modes indicate user defined and built in sets of keys/maps.
        This set of strings indicates the name/order of the input modes which will toggle, if only builtin
        modes are used no further action is needed. <br>
        However if a custom input mode is desired then the input mode itself must be defined as well
        specifically by defining an attribute called @vkb-InputModeName or @im-InputModeName for
        a text field input mode.
    </p>
    <p>
        The following input modes are builtin to the VKB:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>ABC - English</li>
        <li>123 - numbers</li>
        <li>.,123 - numbers and symbols</li>
        <li>.,? - symbos mode</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following input modes are builtin to the TextField
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abc - first upper case</li>
        <li>ABC - Upper case</li>
        <li>abc - Lower case</li>
        <li>123 - Numeric</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
